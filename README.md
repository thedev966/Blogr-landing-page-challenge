# Blogr Landing Page

This is a website I made for Frontend Mentor Challenge fully using only HTML/CSS and a bit of JS (nothing scary lol). I've done both Desktop and Mobile version of it. Mainly, I coded Desktop version for 1300px width and mobile version is made for 395px width and below. I've added few more media query breakpoints but I only focused on these two, so if you try the website out on devices with width different than 1300px and 395px, it may look ugly and overflowed. This website could have been made faster and with less lines of code if I used React but the challenge was to only use plain HTML/ CSS and vanilla JS.

If you would like to see a live version of the website, check out the link below:
